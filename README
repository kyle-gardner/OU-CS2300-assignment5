how to use

run the jar file with 
	java -jar assignment5.jar

once it starts it will print
1. kg -> lbs
2. mi -> km
3. grams -> ounces
4. mm -> in

your input would look like this if you wanted to convert 10 kg to lbs
	1 10

that is, (first option kg -> lbs, 10 kg)

if you dont input enough parameters it will restart, and if enter a wrong first option (something that isnt 1,2,3, or 4) it will restart
